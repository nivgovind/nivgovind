## 🚀 About Me

> If you’ve ever wondered what happens when you cross a caffeine molecule with a Python script, you’re in the right repo.

- 🧑‍💻 I automate browsers for fun and profit (and sometimes just for the memes).
- 🛠️ I break things, then automate the fixing process.
- 🤖 I use AI tools so much, my keyboard is starting to ask for royalties.
- 🥇 Once wrote a script to automate writing scripts. Still debugging it.

## 🧠 Fun Facts

- I treat README sections like code comments: half are jokes, half are useful, and the rest are TODOs.
- My browser history is 90% Stack Overflow, 10% “how to write a good README”.
- I believe every bug is just an undocumented feature waiting for a README update.
