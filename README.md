## 🏆 Career Highlights
I am analyst and a knowledge worker, currently focused on identifying and analyzing the potential in data and emerging tools and frameworks. Love figuring out new challenges and making an impact.

My recent coursework include big data systems, high-performance computing, business analytics. API development (Django / FastAPI), and workflow automation, non technical course work such as formal training in managerial communications, business process engineering (covering agile etc.)

I have previously working with web development (ruby on rails, react, html/css), setting up automations (UIPath, Automation anywhere), API development (Django, FastAPI), analytics projects (Python libraries (airflow, n8n, seaborn, etc) in CRM, banking (fintech) and now healthcare.

Personally, I’m driven by free food, accessible tech for all and currently working toward my Level 3000 “monk developer” status (I made that up) in Python.
